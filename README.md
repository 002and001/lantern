flashlight-build is a [gost](https://github.com/getlantern/gost) project that
provides repeatable builds and consolidated pull requests for flashlight (now
lantern). **It's very important to read the gost documentation thoroughly in
order to build this project.**

## Building Flashlight

### Requisites

* [Go 1.4.x](https://golang.org/dl/).
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* An OSX or Linux host.

We are going to create a Docker image that will take care of compiling Lantern
for Windows and Linux, in order to compile Lantern for OSX you'll need an OSX
host, this is a limitation caused by Lantern depending on C code and OSX build
tools for certain features.

### Building the docker image

In order to build the docker image open a terminal, `cd` into the
`flashlight-build` project and execute `make docker`:

```sh
cd $FLASHLIGHT_BUILD
make docker
```

This will take a while, be patient, you only need to do this once.

## Building Lantern binaries

### Building for Linux

If you want to build for Linux on all supported architectures, use:

```sh
make linux
```

You can also build for Linux 386:

```sh
make linux-386
file lantern_linux_386
# lantern_linux_386: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
```

Or only for amd64:

```sh
make linux-amd64
file lantern_linux_amd64
# lantern_linux_amd64: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
```

### Building for Windows

Lantern supports the 386 architecture on Windows. In order to build Lantern on
Windows use:

```sh
make windows
file lantern_windows_386.exe
# lantern_windows_386.exe: PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel 80386 32-bit
```

### Building for OSX

Lantern supports the amd64 architecture on OSX. In order to build Lantern on
OSX you'll need an OSX host. Run the following command:

```sh
make darwin
file lantern_darwin_amd64
# lantern_darwin_amd64: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

### Building all binaries

If you want to build all supported binaries of Lantern you may use this
shortcut:

```sh
make binaries
```

## Packaging

Packaging requires some special environemnt variables.

### OSX

Lantern on OS X is packaged as the `Lantern.app` app bundle, distributed inside
of a drag-and-drop dmg installer. The app bundle and dmg can be created using:

```sh
VERSION=2.0.0-beta2 make package-darwin
file Lantern.dmg
# Lantern.dmg: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 100k
```

`make package-darwin` signs the Lantern.app using the BNS code signing
certificate in your KeyChain. The
[certificate](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/osx-code-signing-certificate.p12)
and
[password](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/osx-code-signing-certificate.p12.txt)
can be obtained from
[too-many-secrets](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets).

If signing fails, the script will still build the app bundle and dmg, but the
app bundle won't be signed. Unsigned app bundles can be used for testing but
should never be distributed to end users.

The background image for the DMG is
`installer-resources/darwin/dmgbackground.svg` and the icon is in
`lantern.icns`.

### Packaging for Windows

Lantern on Windows is distributed as an installer built with
[nsis](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/). The installer is built and signed with
`make package-windows`.

For `make package-windows` to be able to sign the executable, the environment varaibles
`SECRETS_DIR` and `BNS_CERT_PASS` must be set to point to the secrets directory
and the
[password](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/build-installers/env-vars.txt#L3)
of the BNS certificate.  You can set the environment variables and run the
script on one line, like this:

```sh
SECRETS_DIR=$PATH_TO_TOO_MANY_SECRETS BNS_CERT_PASS='***' \
VERSION=2.0.0-beta1 make package-windows
```

### Packaging for Ubuntu

Lantern on Ubuntu is distributed as a `.deb` package. You can generate a Debian
package with:

```sh
VERSION=2.0.0-beta2 make package-linux
```

The version string must match the Debian requirements:

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version

This will build both 386 and amd64 packages.

### Generating all packages

```sh
SECRETS_DIR=$PATH_TO_TOO_MANY_SECRETS BNS_CERT_PASS='***' VERSION=2.0.0-beta1 make packages
```

## Other tasks

### Generating assets

```sh
make genassets
```

If the environemnt variable `UPDATE_DIST=true` is set, `make genassets` also
updates the resources in the dist folder.

An annotated tag can be added like this:

```sh
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m"Tagged 1.0.0"
git push --tags
```

The script `tagandbuild.bash` tags and runs crosscompile.bash.

`./tagandbuild.bash <tag>`

Note - ./crosscompile.bash omits debug symbols to keep the build smaller.

Note - tagandbuild.bash requires the BNS_CERT and BNS_CERT_PASS environment
variables to sign the windows executable. See Packaging for Windows below.

### Updating Icons

The icons used for the system tray are stored in
src/github/getlantern/flashlight/icons. To apply changes to the icons, make
your updates in the icons folder and then run `./updateicons.bash`.

### Continuous Integration with Travis CI

Continuous builds are run on Travis CI. These builds use the `.travis.yml`
configuration.  The github.com/getlantern/cf unit tests require an envvars.bash
to be populated with credentials for cloudflare. The original `envvars.bash` is
available
[here](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/envvars.bash).
An encrypted version is checked in as `envvars.bash.enc`, which was encrypted
per the instructions [here](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/).
