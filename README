Lantern provides access to web sites that are blocked through a network of P2P proxies. To run Lantern on Linux desktop (with a UI for configuring it), you may need to run one of the following, depending on your Linux variety:

apt-get install libxtst6
yum install xorg-x11-deprecated-libs

In that case, you'll also need to add the following to your ~/.lantern/lantern.properties file:

linuxui=true

To simply run a command line version to proxy traffic (such as on a server you're willing to donate to the cause), you can run ./run.bash from the command line as long as you have maven and java installed.
