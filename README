Lantern provides access to web sites that are blocked through a network of P2P proxies. To run it from a checked out copy of the code, you need Maven and Java installed, and then you just need to run:

$./run.bash

That's really a "build and then run" script that'll grab all your dependencies and will run Lantern. 

If you're running on Linux and want to run in headless mode without a UI, you'll also need to add the following to your ~/.lantern/lantern.properties file:

linuxui=false

That can be useful if you want to just keep Lantern running all the time on a server, for example (highly encouraged!).

Depending on your Linux configuration, you may need to run one of the following if you want to run the UI that assists in configuring Lantern.

sudo apt-get install libxtst6
sudo yum install xorg-x11-deprecated-libs
